Alea iacta est

Alea iacta est (The die is cast) is a Latin phrase attrib
uted by Suetonius
(as iacta alea est) to Julius Caesar on January 10, 49 BC
as he led his army across the Rubicon river in Northern Ita
ly. With this step,
he entered Italy at the head of his army in defiance of the
Senate and began
his long civil war against Pompey and the Optimates. The ph
rase has been
adopted in Italian (Il dado è tratto), Romanian (Zarurile a
u fost aruncate),
Spanish (La suerte está echada), French (Les dés sont jeté
s), Portuguese (A
sorte está lançada), Dutch (De teerling is geworpen),
German (Der Würfel ist gefallen), Hungarian (A kocka el van
vetve) and many other languages to
indicate that events have passed a point of no return.
